#  Stock Closing Price Prediction

This project explores machine learning models to predict the next-day closing prices of five major stocks: **AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, and TSLA**.

##  Overview
Historical stock data (2018â€“2023) was used to engineer lag-based and technical features, such as:
- Previous day close & volume
- Moving averages (MA5, MA10)
- Price range & gain
- Rolling volatility

Four regression models were developed and compared:
-  Linear Regression
-  Random Forest
-  Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR)
-  XGBoost

Models were evaluated on:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- RÂ² score

## ðŸš€ Results
| Model            | Best Performance |
|------------------|------------------|
| Linear Regression| RÂ² > 0.96 |
| Random Forest    | RÂ² ~ 0.74â€“0.91 |
| GBR              | RÂ² ~ 0.82â€“0.91 |
| XGBoost          | RÂ² ~ 0.84â€“0.94 |

 **XGBoost delivered the best performance overall**, especially on volatile stocks like TSLA.

##  Next Steps
- Engineer additional technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
- Explore time-series specific models (ARIMA, LSTM)
- Hyperparameter tuning
